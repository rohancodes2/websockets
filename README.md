# Chat Application using Spring Boot (Web Sockets)
Realtime Chat Application- Applying Web Sockets using Spring Boot

Realtime Applications need bi-directional communication i.e. Server can send response without a request

HTTP protocol uses uni-directional approach which requires client to send a request to get any response from the Server.

Realtime applications like chat application, stock market application need continuous broadcast of data which can be achieved using Web Sockets.

This is a simple chat application like Teams which creates a chat session or users to join! You can try opening the URL on multiple tabs to simulate this scenario
